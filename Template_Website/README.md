Hello, name is Melissa.  I'm currently enrolled at the University of Minnesota on the Twin Cities Campus, and just starting a Masters program in Scientific and Technical Communication.  

Education - 
I grew up in the Twin Cities, and started my college career at Minnesota State University, Mankato.  I was a full time student there for three years, and studied Secondary Education, and French.  Right after 09/11/19 I moved to Le Mans, France where I worked for one year as an Assistant English Teacher in two elementary schools and one middle school.  After that I finished my undergraduate degree in English, with a minor in French from the University of Minnesota on the Twin Cities campus.  I have spent the last twenty years working at a local healthcare organization.  Now I'm enrolled full time again at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities campus.

Interests - 
I enjoy spending time with my family and friends.  I like trying new restaurants, gardening, bicyling, and hiking.  In relation to my career goals I also enjoy writing, learning new technologies, and healthcare.
